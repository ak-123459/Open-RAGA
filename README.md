[**RAG(Retrieval augmented generations)**](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation ) is a techniques that make [**LLM**](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/large-language-models)
responses more accurate and generate more contextual responses .By applying 
[**RAG(Retrieval augmented generations)**](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation) and [prompt engineering](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-engineering)  we developed a customer services assistant for a poster printing shop.this is a Open-source project anybody that interested to developed his own chatbot this project for them.just need to apply prompt engineering and RAG techniques.

- ## **Project Overview**

In toady tech world generative artificial intelligence(GenAi) has many applications in different domains Every company wants to integrate ai models on production.why because after revolutionary development of large language models(LLMs) many real world and complex problems are solving.these large language models actually trained on large text , images data and using the attention mechanism they can understand pattern that make them more powerful.So in this projects we combined the natural language processing capabilities of LLM with the RAG(retrieval augmented generations) and [prompt engineering](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-engineering) to build a real world chatbot application.

- ## **Dataset**
- **Source:** Collected from Alankar Printing services and advertisement agency.
  
- **Type of Data:** Includes shop information, product names, descriptions, prices, greetings ,etc.some synthetic user-bot chat data files.***Note:-*** some data files generated by the Chatgpt to reduce data collection time.
  
- **Time Period:** Collected from April 2025 - June 2025.
  
- **Size:** 9 files related to buisness_info, greetings,order placement,farewell etc.
  
- **Format:**  .txt files.
  
- ***License and Usage Restrictions:*** 
- The dataset is for internal development or research use only.
  
- Do not redistribute or publish without permission from the original shop or data owner.

  
- ***Intened use:***
  This dataset is intended for training and testing retail-oriented chatbot models.developers can replace it with it's own data files.

 - ## **Model**
- [gemma-1b-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-3-1b-it) instructions tuned large language model.
  
**Note:-** any instructions base large language models can be used.we recommend google/gemma-3-27b-it (for large scale projects).
