Health & Wellness
Eklavya is committed to the overall wellness of our students. Come together to share Spirituality and Fellowship.
Wellness is the pursuit of balance in seven dimensions. Each dimension contributes to our own sense of wellness or quality of life, and each affects and overlaps the others. At times one may be more prominent than others, but neglect of any one dimension for any length of time has adverse effects on overall health.  Many people think about “wellness” in terms of physical health only. Wellness, however, is much more than physical health. Wellness is a full integration of physical, mental and spiritual well-being. It is a complex interaction that leads to quality of life.

The Seven Dimensions Of Wellness Include
Physical
Emotional
Intellectual
Social
Spiritual
Environmental
Occupational
